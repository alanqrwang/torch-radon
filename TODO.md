TODO:
 - Fix TODOs for cone-flat
 - Fix non square images 3D
 - Add support for volume translation 3D
 - Add non uniform scales
 - migrate all benchmarks to dedicated repo
 - tune exec configurations
 - provide automatic exec configurator
 - look for optimizations in generated PTX
 - Document new API
 - Remove unnecessary files

DONE:
 - Fix fft warnings in FBP
 - more detailed benchmarks
 - Fix non square images 2D
 - Add support for volume translation 2D
 - 1D layered textures to speedup backward (no speedup but more limitations, discarded)
 - Clean API for cone-flat projection
 - Tests for cone-flat projection
